# Sudoku_Solver
It is a 3x3 sudoku, solved using backtracking. It has two versions:
1. GUI version in which you can play a game.
2. Command-line version that directly solves the sudoku and prints output (solution.py).

# Requirements for GUI version
Python module pygame

# How To Play
To play the GUI version:
1. Run SudokuGUI.py. A window will appear.
2. Select an empty cell in the grid.
3. Enter any number using keyboard. The number will appear gray i.e. it is not your final input.
4. If you want to delete the value you entered, press DEL key.
5. If you are sure about the value you entered and want to lock it, press ENTER key. 
6. If the value is correct, it will turn into black, else a 'X' symbol will appear in the bottom and the cell will again become empty.
7. Once all cells are filled, the window will be closed automatically.

Note: In the bottom right hand side of the window, a timer is running that shows the time elapsed.
